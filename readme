Check out and build this project and go to package com.retailprocess
Run main class named with ApplicationInitializer as a java program
I have created one dummy user as Affiliate user and it would be tested by Affiliate user by default, 
You can change this user as an employee or customer by changing Affiliate 
e.g. User user = Employee.builder() and set user type like UserType.Employee.name().
Created the Testdata class for creating a test data at run time and will be helpful in running the Test class.
I have created some test cases for this in OrderServiceImplTest file where I covered all the test cases.
Run the file by right click and Run as Junit test and you find all the test cases running fine.
